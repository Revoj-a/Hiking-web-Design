        <img src="Images/hiker1.jpg" />
        <p class="details">
          Determining what level of hiker you are can be an important tool when
          planning future hikes. This hiking level guide will help you plan
          hikes according to different hike rating set by various websites like
          All Trails and Modern Hiker. What type of hiker are you - novice,
          moderate, advanced moderate, expert, or expert backpacker?
        </p>
        <h1>WHAT LEVEL OF HIKER ARE YOU?</h1>
        <p class="details">
          If you're new to hiking or have been even hiking for a while, you
          might notice that certain websites like
          <a href="#">Mount Parawagan</a> or <a href="#">All Trails</a> use
          trail rankings as a way to rate the level of difficulty of a trial.<br /><br />

          ><br /><br />
          As a general rule of thumb,
          <b
            >if you're a new hiker, it's best to stick with the ratings systems
            suggested by websites.</b
          >
          After you've got some experience under your belt, you'll know how much
          distance, elevation increase, and length of time you'll be able to
          handle.

        <h1>DETERMINING YOUR HIKING LEVEL</h1>
        <p class="details">
          1. <b>Novice:</b> Someone who is new to hiking or has little
          experience with hiking. A pace for a beginning hiker would be slow or
          easy paced. This person may not exercise in other areas of their life.
          Or they may and just be new to hiking. Elevation gains and distance
          are minimal. Surfaces are generally flat with minimal difficult
          terrain. <br /><br />
          2. <b>Advanced Novice:</b> A person new to hiking but still unfamiliar
          with different types of terrain or elevation gains. They may have
          experienced hikes of a new hours with small levels of inclines of
          500-1000 feet. An advanced novice hiker hikes at a generally easy pace
          but may have to take breaks more frequently as the distance or
          elevation of the hike increases. <br /><br />
          3. <b>Moderate:</b> This type of person on a more regular basis. This
          type of person may also partake in more frequent types of exercise in
          other aspects of their life. Hikes can last for half a day and have
          elevation gains of a few thousand feet. A moderate hiker will be able
          to hike at a faster pace and be able to handle longer inclines without
          feeling exhausted. At this stage, a moderate hiker has also started
          venturing out into hikes with different weather conditions that
          require more planning. <br /><br />
          4. <b>Advanced Moderate:</b> This person has experience with many
          hikes lasting at least half a day. This type of hiker is able to
          handle elevation gains of several thousand feet. Hiking takes place at
          a moderate place but the hiker also has enough experience of when to
          slow the pace to conserve energy. Hikes can last all day. An advanced
          moderate hiker also has experience hiking in different weather
          conditions and has a general idea of what to prepare for in colder and
          hot conditions. <br /><br />
          5. <b>Expert:</b> This type of hiker has had much experience with day
          hikes and hiking in different weather conditions. At this point, the
          hiker is prepared to be out there throughout the night, has the
          knowledge of when to hike at a fast pace, at a slow pace to conserve
          energy, and when to rest. This type of hiker will be able to plan
          hikes of up to a few days and how to plan accordingly. <br /><br />
          6. <b>Expert Backpacker:</b> Now, I'd imagine there are different
          levels of a backpacker just as there are a hiker. I can say that
          knowing that I've never been backpacking before. But, an expert
          backpacker is someone who has been hiking for multiple days at a time
          and has put together at least a week of hiking/camping time in. This
          type of hiker is prepared to take on the
          <a href="#">Mount Pulag Trail</a>, <a href="#">Spartan Trail</a>, or
          spend several days hiking through various types of wilderness.
        </p>
        <h1>WHAT HIKING LEVEL ARE YOU?</h1>
        <p class="details">
          So what type of hiker are you? I'd currently rate myself as someone
          just getting into the novice stage. I'm just now starting to
          experience hiking in cooler terrains with higher elevations closer to
          10,000 feet. Knowing what hiking level you're at can be important for
          planning future hikes. When looking at hiking ratings through
          different apps and websites, you can use your own experience as a
          guide for determining the true level of difficulty.
          <br /><br /><br />
          Does anyone have anything else to add to the different hiking levels?
          What hiking level are you and where do you want to be?
