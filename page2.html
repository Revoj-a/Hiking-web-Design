          <p class="details">
            Hitting the trail for the first time? Time for a fit check! Fashion
            might not be very important on the trail, but your hiking outfit can
            still make the differences between a fun time and miserable one.
            However, that doesn't mean you need to go out and buy a whole new
            wardrobe for your first hike-in fact, you may already have the right
            outfit ready to go. Dress appropriately with these tips.
          </p>
          <h1>CHECK THE WEATHER</h1>
          <p class="details">
            It's a no-brainer: You can't pick your hiking outfit until you know
            what conditions you're dressing for. Keep in mind that the weather
            at the trailhead oi in a nearby town won't necessarily be the same
            as at your hiking destination. High elevations and summits tend to
            be colder and windier that lower spots, and storms may be more
            likely. Prepare for the absolute worst weather you might encounter -
            it's better to be overprepared than underprepared.
          </p>
          <h1>FOR YOU FIRST HIKING OUTFIT, USE WHAT YOU HAVE</h1>
          <p class="details">
            Hiking-specific apparel is great, but for your first hike, you
            likely already have what you need in your closet. Moisture - wicking
            activewear like what you'd wear to the gym or on a run functions on
            most hikes, too. Choose clothing that's comfortable, flexible, and
            protects you from weather, spiky or poisinous plants, and bugs.
          </p>
          <h1>BACKPACK</h1>
          <p class="details">
            A comfortable and durable backpack is crucial for carrying all your
            gear. Consider factors such as size, weight, and features when
            selecting the perfect backpack for your needs.
          </p>
          <h1>HYDRATION SYSTEM</h1>
          <p class="details">
            Staying hydrated is crucial, so pack a water bottle or hydration
            reservoir that meets your capacity, weight, and ease-of-use needs.
          </p>
          <img src="images/image7.jpg" />
          <h1>WHAT SHOES TO WEAR HIKING</h1>
          <p class="details">
            Sore feet lead to a bad time on trail. For your first few hikes,
            wear any sturdy, closed-toe athletic shoes you have. Sneakers are
            fine for most easy to moderate trails, but you may want shoes with
            some extra traction and support for steep hikes.
          </p>
          <h1>NAVIGATION TOOLS (map, compass, or GPS)</h1>
          <p class="details">
            Navigating your route is essential, so bring a map, compass, or
            GPSdevice and familiarize yourself with their use beforehand.
          </p>
          <h1>FIRST-AID KIT</h1>
          <p class="details">
            Carry a first-aid kit with essentials supplies to address minor
            injuries and medical emergencies. Customize your kit to include
            items specific to your needs and the nature of your hike.
          </p>
          <h1>MULTI-TOOL OR KNIFE</h1>
          <p class="details">
            A multi-tool or knife is handy for various tasks, such as gear
            repair, food preparation, or emergrncy situations.
          </p>
          <h1>HEADLAMP OR FLASHLIGHT</h1>
          <p>
            Bring them on a go for illumination during early morning, evening,
            or emergency situations.
          </p>
          <div class="hiking-tools">

            <img src="images/image9.jpg" />
            <img src="images/image10.jpg" />
          </div>
          <h1>UNDERWEAR FOR HIKING</h1>
          <p class="details">
            For your first hike, wear whatever you feel comfortable in. Got a
            favorite pair of boxers for working out? Chances are you'll be happy
            in them on the trail, too. As you start going for longer hikes,
            overnights, and backpacking trips, your preferences might change.
            Most hikers prefer synthetic or wool underwear instead of cotton.
            Just make sure you wear something that's comfortable for extended
            durations of movement - prominent seams that might cause chafing are
            a no-no.
          </p>
          <h1>LAYERING FOR A HIKE</h1>
          <p class="details">
            On the trail, it's all about having options. Conditions might change
            as you hike, and your body temperature will fluctuate between
            periods of exertion and rest. Wear light layers against your body.
            <br /><br />
            Unless you're hiking somewhere that night time temperatures are
            consistently above 79, always wear or carry a midlayer, such as a
            fleece or wool hoodie. It might be scorching at your car, but you
            never know when you might get chilly during your hike.
            <br /><br />
            In colder temperatures, an insulating layer like a puffy jacket is a
            good idea. Stash it in your pack while you hike, and pull it on to
            preserve warmth while you snack or take in the views. Dor cold
            hikes, bring a warm hat and gloves or mittens. It's never a bad idea
            to pack two pairs of gloves: a light pair for while you're moving,
            and a warmer pair for when you're stopped.
            <br /><br />
